# Next steps

## 1. Major improvements

### 1.1. Improve code standardization

The code has already been refactored to improve its readability and maintainability. However, there are still some parts of the code that need to be improved. The main points are:

- Improve the code comments.
- Improve the code documentation.
- Improve the code structure.

### 1.2. Improve the error handling

The error handling is still very basic. The compiler needs to be able to handle errors more effectively. The main points are:

- Improve the error messages.
- Improve the error handling.
- Improve the error recovery.

## 2. Integrate the Compiler with the flex and bison tools

At the current stage, the aqua complier is using a python written lexical and syntactic analyzer. The next step is to integrate the compiler with the flex and bison tools, using some kind of virtual machine to run the code.
